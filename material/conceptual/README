Material : Conceptual
---------------------


This material is aimed at conveying core programming skills in a
'simple' dynamically typed interpretted language like Python, minimising
low level concerns.

It is intended that this material should be more immediately gratifying
to the student, whereas material in the Implementation section will be
more challenging but prepare students better for certain types of
programming work in industry.
