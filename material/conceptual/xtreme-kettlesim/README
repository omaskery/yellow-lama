XTREME KETTLESIM
----------------


These exercises involve simple 'boiling a kettle' programs that
illustrate basic programming concepts.

Due to the nature of Git and Python's "import" behaviour, before
attempting each exercise it is important to create a symlink to the
kettlesim library inside the exercise folder.

For example, exercise 00 is in this folder:
	yellow-lama/material/conceptual/xtreme-kettlesim/exercise00
The kettlesim library is in:
	yellow-lama/material/conceptual/xtreme-kettlesim/kettlesim

Using "ln" to create a symlink in the exercise00 folder to point to
the kettlesim folder. If you navigate into the exercise00 folder this
can be achieved by writing:

	ln -s ../kettlesim kettlesim
