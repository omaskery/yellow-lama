This project is for exploring the creation of some educational material
for teaching programming.

Initially the targetted age group is adults, in a workshop setting with
a small number of students and demonstrators.

Currently the plan is a parallel approach involving high level, abstract
programming skills being acquired through a 'simple' high level
language such as python (Python 3). More concrete, 'implementation'
knowledge will be taught with C++ (C++11 onward).

Using simple exercises that build in complexity up to occasional
'challenge' tasks that are less guided but leave room for exploratory
learning.
